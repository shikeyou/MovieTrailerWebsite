## Introduction

This is project 1 for Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree. Main objective of this project:

* Dynamically create a movie trailer website using Python 

## Requirements

You will need these installed in your computer:

* [Python 2.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Files

These are the files that come with this project:

* **media.py:** This defines a `Movie` class which stores attributes of a movie and allows users to instantiate instances of `Movie`s

* **entertainment_center.py:** This contains the `main()` function which creates a list of `Movie` instances and feeding that through `fresh_tomatoes.open_movies_page()` to generate the actual HTML file

* **fresh_tomatoes.py:** This is the template module given, with slight modifications so that it can accept additional information about a `Movie` and display them

## Running The Project

In a shell, run the *entertainment_center.py* Python script:

    > python entertainment_center.py
	
A new file *fresh_tomatoes.html* will automatically be generated and opened up in your web browser.
